// Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time, allowing you to recall specific versions later. In software development, version control is crucial for several reasons:

// Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work.

// History and Audit Trails: Version control maintains a history of changes, allowing developers to track when and why specific changes were made. This is invaluable for troubleshooting and auditing.

// Branching and Merging: Version control systems allow developers to create branches to work on new features or bug fixes independently. The changes made in these branches can be merged back into the main codebase.

// Rollbacks: If an issue arises, developers can roll back to a previous, stable version of the code.

// Parallel Development: Different teams or individuals can work on different features or modules concurrently, and the changes can be integrated systematically.
