// The .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. This is important 
// because there are often files or directories generated by the build process, IDEs, or system files that you don't want to 
// include in version control. Ignoring these files helps to keep
//  the repository clean, reduces unnecessary conflicts, and ensures that only essential files are tracked.
