// GitHub is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. It provides a platform for hosting repositories, collaboration, and social coding. Some key features include pull requests, issues, and wikis, making it easy for teams to collaborate on software projects. Developers can clone repositories, make changes, and submit pull requests to contribute to projects.

// Alternative platforms to GitHub include:

// GitLab: Similar to GitHub, GitLab offers source code management, continuous integration, and more. It can be self-hosted or used as a cloud service.

// Bitbucket: Owned by Atlassian, Bitbucket supports both Git and Mercurial. It offers features like pull requests, code review, and integration with other Atlassian products.

// SourceForge: An older platform that provides version control, bug tracking, and collaboration tools.
